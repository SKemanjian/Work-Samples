This is a simple ruler app that I designed in Android Studio. 
It was designed with the intention of giving the user a way to measure lengths using their phone.
The length varies depending on the dimensions of the user's screen.
Touch features are included, allowing the user to add onto the length by double tapping and an accurate measurement by sliding.
